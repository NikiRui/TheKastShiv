## The Kast Shiv ##

_ fast, easy, effective _


This is an attempt to build the Isaac version of the
Flipper group's Kast/Shane reduction pipeline.

Right now, the quicklooks Cenko pipeline works well (with
the UREKA python/pyraf/iraf installation), and I am running
into significant problems with the silverclubb full pipeline.


# goals of this new code #

- highly automated
- does not require IDL
- cuts no corners
- does not require a complicated environment
- lots of documentation
- easy to start/stop/resume at any point in the reduction
- robust to errors
